If you live in the Pacific Northwest, there’s a solid chance you’ll stumble across the “Oregon” variant of the Dark-eyed Junco nearly every day. From their distinct body and head shape to their pitch-black hoods, this sparrow is the perfect mix of prevalent and distinguishable for anyone looking to show off their knowledge of avian fauna to friends and family. So the next time someone tells you about a little bird they saw with one with a dark head, brown back, and white belly, you’ll know exactly what it’s called!

Dark-eyed Juncos are very common winter feeder visitors in the United States. There exist six regional variants that all share the same signature color pattern, the Oregon Junco [shown above] being the most common type seen on the Pacific coast.

The call of a Junco consists of a short trill that can vary in length and pitch depending on its intended purpose. In early spring, one can here a vast repertoire of warbling phrases in and around forests and suburban neighborhoods.

-	The life span of the Junco can range anywhere from 3 to 11 years. 
-	The global population has been estimated at around 630 million individuals.

A paragon example of an “early bird,” the American Robin is no stranger to lawns and grassy fields up and down the West Coast. Near the end of winter, be on the lookout for this orange-breasted flyer as it forages around in search of insects and fruits.

Though often affiliated with the coming of spring, these Robins are no less active during the winter seasons, but because they spend most of colder months roosting in trees and nesting, they’re a much rarer sight to see.

Robins often begin the day eating a diet of insects and worms, but tend to prefer fruit in the afternoon. This shift diet throughout the day is likely due to common insects like grubs and worms retreating underground once the sun becomes too hot for them, forcing the robins to find an alternative source of food.

The Robins call consists of a series of low whistled phrases. Individual phrase are delivered rather quickly, but there’s often a long pause between each one.

-	The average life lifespan of an American Robin is about 6 years

Though it's considered to be one of the most common hummingbirds in the Pacific Northwest, hummingbirds themselves are hard enough to come by that the Anna's Hummingbird is defiantly still a rare sight to behold.

You can attract hummingbirds to your house by mixing half a cup of sugar with two cups of water and putting it in a hummingbird feeder. Leaving sugar water out like this simulates the hummingbirds' primary food source of nectar.

Hummingbirds are very peculiar animals. The Anna's Hummingbird is about the size of a pingpong ball and weighs only 5 grams (about as much as a nickel). Hummingbirds do have legs but they are really only useful for perching as they can't walk or hop with them, as best they can scoot from side to side while standing on a branch.

While there is no universally agreed upon name for a flock of hummingbirds, some commonly used terms include a bouquet, a shimmer, a hover, a glittering, or a tune of hummingbirds.

Hummingbirds have a normal body temperature of 107 degrees Fahrenheit, compared to 97.7 degrees in humans. That said, their average body temperature can fall as low as 48 degrees Fahrenheit depending on the outside temperatures. At these low temperatures the hummingbird enters a state known as a torpor, where their breathing and heart rate slow dramatically, thought the hummingbird can recover from this in only a few minutes once things warm up.



# Black-capped Chickadee

Info about Black-capped Chickadee here.

Whether your're already an avid birder or just getting started, you probably herd the name of this songbird before. Form their large puffy body to their easily recognizable "chickadee-dee-dee!" call, the Black-capped Chickadee is an iconic bird you can find year-round anywhere in the northern-central United States and British Columbia.

The Black-capped Chickadee has a (wouldn't you know it) black-cap and bib, highlighted with white streaks over its cheeks. They associate in flocks and have a complex language that bears some resemblance to our own. Even their trademark "chickadee" call is used to warn the other members of the flock of possible danger. The more trailing "dees" in the chickadee's call, the higher the threat level.

Chickadees also like to bury and hide seeds and food items for later use. They rarely stash more that one item in the same place and are able to remember thousands of individual hiding spots.
