-	The life span of the Junco can range anywhere from 3 to 11 years.

A paragon example of an “early bird,” the American Robin is no stranger to lawns and grassy fields up and down the West Coast. Near the end of winter, be on the lookout for this orange-breasted flyer as it forages around in search of insects and fruits.

Though often affiliated with the coming of spring, these Robins are no less active during the winter seasons, but because they spend most of colder months roosting in trees and nesting, they’re a much rarer sight to see.

Robins often begin the day eating a diet of insects and worms, but tend to prefer fruit in the afternoon. This shift diet throughout the day is likely due to common insects like grubs and worms retreating underground once the sun becomes too hot for them, forcing the robins to find an alternative source of food.

The Robins call consists of a series of low whistled phrases. Individual phrase are delivered rather quickly, but there’s often a long pause between each one.

-	The average life lifespan of an American Robin is about 6 years
